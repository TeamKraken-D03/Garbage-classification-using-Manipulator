# Garbage Classification Using Manipulator

**Authors**: Naren Sundar L, Renny Harlin, Vatturu Pardheev, Charuvarthan T

This project focuses on the classification of waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories using a robot manipulator. It integrates a segmentation-vision model for waste identification and leverages large language models (LLMs) for reasoning and decision-making.

## Project Details

- **Objective**: Automate waste classification and sorting using robotics and AI.
- **Key Components**:
  - Vision-based segmentation for waste identification.
  - Reasoning and classification using LLMs.
  - Robotic manipulator for sorting waste.
